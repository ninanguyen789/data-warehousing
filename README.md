# data-warehousing-project
Cary Leeds Tennis Center, which was established in 2015 in the Bronx, New York, uses a File-based System with old spreadsheets to keep track of clients, appointments, payments, equipment, and maintenance. However, the old system cannot keep up with the company’s success and the high number of demands. To accommodate for this, they have contacted our team to discuss options available. During our first meeting with them, they told us that the main issue with their file-based system is being unable to keep track of scheduled appointments. As a result, they constantly need to cancel appointments because of conflicting schedules. This in turn leads to a loss of revenue for the business, and this needs to be rectified as soon as possible.

After being informed of the issue, our team proposed that the best solution to the problem would be to implement a scheduling database. The database would be primarily focused on their scheduling operation, for which their revenue is derived. This will allow the club to keep track of their business in a more efficient and effective way. During the second meeting, they informed us that they have agreed to have our team “Data Generation” create the scheduling database system for the business.
